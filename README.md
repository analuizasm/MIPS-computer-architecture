# MIPS-computer-architecture :computer:

These are some codes that I made in MIPS as a work for my Computer Architecture class. I'm not a huge knowleadgeable of MIPS so these might not be the best solution, but
they were a great way to learn a little more about how things work at the low-level.
<br> I tried to comment it as much as possible to help me study for my presentation.

P.S: If you are a lost computer science student looking for these codes for some class I strongly recommend that you try to give your own solutions to these "challenges", 
I can guarantee that in the end this will give you a great experience (at least a little bit) :sweat_smile:
